Data Policy Management and Enforcement\nStatus\n\nPalisade is still in the early stages of development.\nAt the moment there are just a few simple implementations to show how Palisade could work - it is not production ready.\nThe descriptions of Palisade below indicate the high level goals of the framework. \n\nComplex data policies\nModern data organisations store lots of datasets that are each managed and accessed according to different data policies. These policies can be complicated and it can be difficult to store and access datasets for analysis across different technologies while ensuring compliance.\nMost technologies don't provide the necessary hooks out of the box for managing these complex data policies. This leads to data being siloed or accesses and APIs being restricted and insight from data is lost. \nPalisade is a set of services for managing and applying complex data policies across different scales and platforms. It provides modular data access controllers and independent, peripheral services to allow policies to be applied before clients access the data.  \nFor example, datasets may have been assembled for specific purposes and, for a given dataset, only particular types of query are permitted for certain types of user. Also, within each dataset a specific user may only be permitted to access a particular subset of the records. Palisade allows the policy for accessing datasets, redacting records and executing the query to be specified independently of the physical data and the platform hosting the data.\nPolicies can be applied on a per item basis. This means that items (e.g. cells) in a record can be redacted or masked based on the contents of the record, the user accessing the record and the justification given for the query.\nWhen a user submits a query (or executes some analytic code), Palisade uses the local information about the user, the platform and the data requested to look up the relevant data policy. This policy is then used by a process, which ideally should be data-local process to get the best performance, to return only the records that are allowed by the policy for the specific user, dataset and query justification. \nMulti-platform compatibility\nPalisade aims to provide a stable framework for defining and applying policy and auditing requirements to data access requests while allowing you to keep up with the fast-changing world of data science tools. Palisade does that by sharing the burden of creating connectors to new data storage technologies and the connectors from new data processing technologies into Palisade. Palisade is not dependant on any platform ecosystem such as Hadoop, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, google.io, etc. \nCentralised or Local Policy\nIf required, Palisade allows an organisation to use centralised services which each deployment of Palisade's data access services can share. This means that your data access policies, audit logs, user account details etc. don't need to be set up duplicated on every system. Of course, Palisade can be deployed locally on a per platform basis.\n\nGetting started\nTo get started, clone the Palisade repo: \ngit clone https://github.com/gchq/Palisade.git\nWe have two simple examples that demonstrate the automated auditing and policy rule enforcement when users read some data. \nThese example should provide a good start to understanding how Palisade works.\n\nTo run the single-jvm-example module follow this guide: single-jvm-example\n\nTo run the REST based example follow this guide: multi-jvm-example\n\n\nFor more details about the code structure see the Developer Guide\nFor details about possible use cases, see the Use Cases\nDocumentation\nOur documentation can be found here.\nLicence\nPalisade is licensed under the Apache 2 license.\nContributing\nWe welcome contributions to the project.

Might just be a need to allow policy to dictate that data needs to be transformed when sent back to client.\n\nCould have\n\nWhen data is written then a data lineage graph can be updated showing where the data came from.\nData retention policies which are used to auto-delete data that has aged off or rewrite files to remove records that have been marked for purging on a given schedule (e.g. every night or once a month).\n\nDesign Principles\n\nReduce the work required to adopt new data processing and data storage technologies.\nThe service and common modules should remain technology agnostic.\nPalisade should scale horizontally and enable monitoring, with the intention being to enable auto-scaling and auto-healing of each micro-service.\nPalisade should also make it easy to debug by enabling the tracing of a request through all the micro-services that make up Palisade.\nMinimise serialisation/de-serialisation by making use of Apache Arrow where sensible. \n\nHigh level architectural diagram\n\nDescription of each component\n\nClient code\nPalisade Service\nData Service\nAudit Service\nUser Service\nPolicy Service\nResource Service\nCache Service\n\nClient code\nThe job of the client code is to send the request for data into Palisade and to interpret the result as required for the data processing technology it is written for.\nThe responsibility for implementations of the client code is to provide users with a way to request data from Palisade in a way that the user has to make minimal changes to how they would normally use that processing technology.\nImplementations of this component will usually require deep understanding of the data processing technology in order to best hook into that technology, without needing to fork the code for that technology.\nPalisade Service\nThe palisade service is the main controller of the Palisade system. \nCheck out the palisade service readme for more details\nData Service\nThe data service is responsible for connecting to the data and sanitising the data before streaming it back to the client.\nCheck out the data service readme for more details\nData Reader\nThe job of the data reader is to read a single resource, serialise it into the format that the set of rules for this resource will expect and then apply those rules before passing the data back to the data service. The data reader should also be able to push down filters where appropriate to optimise the read process, e.g. to only retrieve certain columns from a columnar database or a particular row range.\nAudit Service\nThe audit service is responsible for recording audit logs as requested by other services.\nCheck out the audit service readme for more details\nUser Service\nThe user service is responsible for retrieving details about the user from an authoritative source.\nCheck out the user service readme for more details\nPolicy Service\nThe job of the policy service is to provide the set of rules (filters or transformations) that need to be applied to each resource that has been requested, based on the user and justification.\nCheck out the policy service readme for more details\nResource Service\nThe job of the resource service is to provide the detailed information about each resource based on a resource id (path/alias) being managed by Palisade. That extra information could be the type of data in that resource, when the resource was created, etc.\nCheck out the resource service readme for more details\nCache Service\nThe job of the cache service is to provide a shared cache of the information that the data service is going to require about a read request that has been registered. \nCheck out the cache service readme for more details\nHigh level architecture using a map reduce client\n\nStandard data flow through the Palisade system\n\nThe user makes use of a plug-in (client code) for the data processing technology that they are using which makes it almost invisible to them that they are actually querying data via Palisade.\nFor a distributed workflow that client code will usually be made up of a driver component and an executor/mapper component. The driver component starts by registering the data request with the palisade service, stating the resources/alias mapping to resources that they want to query, along with a user id and a justification for querying the data.\nThe palisade service receives that request and then sends an audit log message to the audit service to log the request.\nThe palisade service then requests the mapping of how to connect to the relevant data service to retrieve each of the resources requested. This may allow aliases which map to a list of resources, which would need to be resolved by the resource service.\nThe palisade service then returns the mapping to the client in response to the client registering the request\nThe palisade service then requests the full details about the user from the user service.\nThe palisade service then requests the policy to be applied to each of the resources, passing in the full user details returned by the user service, any justification passed in by the client code and the list of resources returned by the resource service.\nThe palisade service then caches the response from the policy service in the cache service, so that any palisade service can respond to the data server later on.\nThe client code, having received the mapping of resource-to-connection details, can now split the resources up over its executors and then each executor can request a subset of the resources from the relevant data service.\nThe data service receives the request to read a subset of the resources and passes that request to the palisade service.\nThe palisade service responds to the data service by retrieving from the cache service the response that was cached in step 8.\nThe data service uses the response to loop over all the resources to read the resource and apply the rules applicable to that resource.\nThe filtered and transformed data is then streamed back to the client.\nThe client then formats the code in the way that the data processing technology expects the data, so the user's code can proceed as if palisade was never there.\n\nHow might the system be deployed?\nMicro-service deployment using REST APIs\n\nThis deployment shows how you might have a Palisade service that can use a local audit service component but uses proxies to ask other micro-services for the other information that it requires. Those other micro-services could be running on different machines.\nMonolith deployment\n\nThis deployment shows that it can still works if you want to have all of your services running in the same JVM.\nRoadmap for Palisade\nNear term\n\nCreate a data service broker that uses a queueing mechanism like ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ.\nCreate a HDFS resource service.\nCreate a MongoDB policy service.\nCreate a HDFS text file data service.\nCreate a HDFS CSV file data service.\nCreate a HDFS Parquet data service.\nCreate a HDFS Avro data service.\nCreate command line tool client (so you can alias 'cat', 'grep', etc).\nExplore deployment methods (Ansible/Kubernetes).\nSee if we can hook Palisade into Alluxio, so Alluxio can act as the client code.\nCreate an Apache Spark client.\nCreate a REST client to enable easier coded API access to data (Python/Java client).\n\nMid term\n\nAdd support for pushing down user filters (predicate pushdown).\nAdd write support to the palisade service so it updates the relevant policies, which are set ready to read data back out.\nSupport Java 11+.\n\nLong term\n\nBe able to update a data lineage graph which keeps track of what data sources were used to create this data set and what processing was done at each stage.\nBe able to manage the deletion of data (file/record/item level) to which Palisade is protecting the access, based on purge policies.\n\nWho do I talk to?\n\nRepo owner or admin\n\n"},"doc/use_cases.html":{"url":"doc/use_cases.html","title":"Use Cases","keywords":"","body":"Palisade Use Cases\nReading a stream of data using Apache Spark\nIf you had a data stream in Kafka, you would normally be able to access it using kafka connectors in Java or Python, however it would not apply the data filtering/transformations that are required by the data policies.\nTherefore, we want to be able to provide the user with as similar an experience as possible so the user hardly realises any difference.\nTo do that we would want the user to start the job off by running the following: \nspark.readStream\n    .option(\"justification\", \"example justification\")\n    .format(\"uk.gov.gchq.palisade\")\n    .load(\"data_set\")\n    .select(\"colA\", \"colB\")\n    .show()\n\nWe would expect that Spark would create a filter to be pushed down to the data reader that says it only wants \"colA\" and \"colB\".\nThe Spark client for Palisade would create a user (based on who is running the command) and take the resource, justification and filter to register a data request with the Palisade service. Then the Spark client would then take the response of that request and split the list of resources over the number of executors Spark is running and get each executor to request access to the subset of resources assigned to that executor.\nThe data service receives the request for data and passes that request to the palisade service to validate the request and to get the data access policies that apply to those resources. Then the data service can read the resource applying the column selection (columns requested plus any columns required to apply the policy) then apply the policies, transform the data so only the two requested columns are returned and then stream the data back to the executor that made the request.\nThen the Spark client can format the stream of data into a DataFrame so that the standard Spark code can do the rest of the request.\nTherefore as far as the user is concerned they just had to add the option and use the different format, as they would not be able to access the data via any of the other formats. This keeps the API similar to Spark's standard read API. \nIntegrating Palisade with Alluxio\nGiven that Alluxio already has connectors that allows it to sit between data processing technologies and the data storage technologies; it would be great to hook into Alluxio to apply the Palisade services just before Alluxio feeds the data back to the data processing technology.\nThis would make the Palisade integration transparent to the user (except getting the justification passed through).\nUsing the 'cat' command line tool\nIt should be possible to use command line tools like 'cat' to be able to view files that are being protected by Palisade. \nTo do that we would need to write a client that mimics the behaviour of the 'cat' command but routing the request for data via Palisade. \nThen you could alias 'cat' to run that client code. \nTherefore to the end user there is again very little difference to how they would normally use 'cat' if they did not have the data access policy restrictions.\n"},"service/":{"url":"service/","title":"Services","keywords":"","body":"Services\nA collection of the different Palisade Services.

A non-goal of the audit service is to provide general logging support. Therefore, debug logs and so-forth should not be routed to the audit service. The output of the audit service can be useful for policy auditors for compliance checks and to monitor how rules are being applied. It may also be useful for follow-on machine processing to generate metrics on what data is being accessed, how often, by whom and for what reasons (justifications).\nPalisade is designed for flexible deployment, therefore it is not assumed that all nodes within a cluster have unfettered access to the external network. It may be the case, that only specific cluster \"edge\" nodes are able to communicate externally to/from the cluster. Consequently, another role of the audit service is to function as a central location for the remainder of the Palisade components which themselves may not have external communication. Other services can send audit events to the audit service which can collate and store the events for later review.\nNote that while the audit service provides a central place for audit logging to occur, this doesn't imply that the audit service is a singleton, in a micro-services deployment it is likely that several instances of the same audit service are present in a deployment. It will not matter which particular instance receives an individual audit event.\nIt may also forward certain events on to another non-Palisade service. This allows for the creation of \"auditing alerts\". For example, organisational rules may require that an alert is sent when a particularly sensitive type of action is taken or resource accessed.\nImplementations of the audit service may also include proxies to forward the messages to another Audit service, aggregator's to reduce the volumes of logging to be stored as well as implementations that actually write the logs to storage.\nBy splitting the functionality of the audit components in this way, where they all implement this interface but do some small processing before passing to the next component, for example proxy -> receiver -> aggregator -> storage.\nIt means that if we don't want to aggregate audit records then we just remove the aggregator implementation when building that micro-service.\nAPI Usage\nBearing in mind the notice above, the AuditService class currently only defines one method.\n\nvoid audit(final AuditRequest request)\n\nHopefully little explanation is needed of what this method does, but it is worth stating that the actual action taken by an implementation of AuditService may depend on what is being audited. For example, a simple note of a request being made could simply be written to the audit log, but repeated, denied requests for a resource by a specific user may result in an escalation whereby an alert is raised.\n"},"service/cache-service/":{"url":"service/cache-service/","title":"Cache Service","keywords":"","body":"Cache Service\nNote: As noted in the documentation root Palisade is in an early stage of development, therefore the precise APIs contained in these service modules are likely to adapt as the project matures.\nOverview\nThe core API for the cache service.\nThe purpose of the cache service is to store the information that the data\nservice will require based on a registerDataRequest() made to the Palisade\nservice.

This interface details several methods for obtaining a list of\nresources, e.g. by type or by data format. The methods of this service all return CompletableFutures of\nMaps which link a valid Palisade Resource with a ConnectionDetail object. The\nConnectionDetail objects contain information on how to set up a connection to retrieve a particular resource.\nImplementations of this service do not deal with the filtering or application of security policy to the resources.\nTherefore, a result returned from a method call on this interface doesn't guarantee that the user will be allowed to\naccess it by policy. Other components of the Palisade system will enforce the necessary policy controls to prevent\naccess to resources by users without the necessary access rights.\nImplementation note: None of the getResourcesByXXX  methods in this class will return in error if there\ndon't happen to be any resources that do not match a request, instead they will simply return empty Map\ninstances.\n"},"service/user-service/":{"url":"service/user-service/","title":"User Service","keywords":"","body":"User Service\nNote: As noted in the documentation root Palisade is in an early stage of development, therefore the precise APIs contained in these service modules are likely to adapt as the project matures.\nOverview\nThe User service is responsible for providing the other Palisade components with knowledge of the users of the system. Note that we are avoiding having a separate notion of \"Palisade\"\" users that are distinct from the normal user accounts of the system. There is no such thing as a \"Palisade\"\" user.\nOne of the purposes of this service is to allow Palisade to adopt the whatever notion of user the host environment has. For example, this may from a central directory service such as LDAP, host operating system account or PKI based user authentication.\nThe user service separates this concern from the rest of the system. Other components use this service's API to request user details. Some deployments may also allow Palisade to add users to the system, hence the presence of the addUser() method in the UserService interface.\nAPI Usage\nCurrently the UserService supports adding and retrieving of user details via the two following API calls.\n\nCompletableFuture getUser(final GetUserRequest request) throws NoSuchUserIdException\n\nCompletableFuture addUser(final AddUserRequest request)\n\n\nThe addUser method is used in the example code to allow the configuration of new users for Palisade. The request object contains the details of the user to add. The getUser method allows the retrieval of user details via the User's ID. This is provided to Palisade when the User object is created.\nNotes\nThe API is reasonably simple at present and it is likely that this interface will grow.\nSpecifically, we anticipate that UserService implementations will connect to a account provisioning service as explained above, which will let Palisade retrieve the details of users that it previously knows nothing about. That is, we do not expect that every user retrieved via getUser will have previously been added via a corresponding addUser call.\n"},"example/":{"url":"example/","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Examples\nWe have 2 simple examples that demonstrate the automated auditing and policy rule enforcement when users read some data.\n\nSingle JVM\nMulti JVM\n\n"},"example/single-jvm-example/":{"url":"example/single-jvm-example/","title":"Single JVM","keywords":"","body":"Single JVM Example\nThis example demonstrates 2 different users querying a database. \nThe database has been hardcoded in class: uk.gov.gchq.palisade.example.data.ExampleSimpleDataReader and has been loaded with the following records:\n\n\n\nValue\nVisibility\nTimestamp\n\n\n\n\nitem1a\npublic\n1\n\n\nitem1b\npublic\n10\n\n\nitem1c\npublic\n20\n\n\nitem1d\nprivate\n20\n\n\nitem2a\npublic\n1\n\n\nitem2b\npublic\n10\n\n\nitem2c\npublic\n20\n\n\nitem2d\nprivate\n20\n\n\n\nThe policies and users have been hardcoded in class: uk.gov.gchq.palisade.example.client.ExampleSimpleClient.\nPolicy have defined the following rules:\n\nAge off - the timestamp must be greater than 12\n\nVisibility - the user must have the correct level of authorisation to for the visibility label\n\n\nThe example will be run with 2 users:\n\nAlice is an admin and can see both public and private records\n\nBob is a standard user, who can only see public records\n\n\nWhen you run the example you will see the data has been redacted accordingly.\nTo run the example following the steps (from the root of the project):\n\nCompile the code\nmvn clean install -Pquick\n\n\nRun the example\n./example/single-jvm-example/scripts/run.sh\n\nThis just runs the java class: uk.gov.gchq.palisade.example.SingleJvmExample.
